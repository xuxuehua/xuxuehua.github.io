## Triangular theory of love

The **triangular theory of love** is a theory of [love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love) developed by [Robert Sternberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sternberg), a member of the Psychology Department at [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University). During his time as a professor, Sternberg emphasized his research in the fields of intelligence, creativity, wisdom, leadership, thinking styles, ethical reasoning, love, and hate. In the context of [interpersonal relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship), "the three components of love, according to the triangular theory, are an intimacy component, a passion component, and a decision/commitment component."[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_theory_of_love#cite_note-1)

Sternberg says that intimacy refers to "feelings of closeness, connectedness, and bondedness in loving relationships", passion refers to "the drives that lead to romance, physical attraction, sexual consummation, and related phenomena in loving relationships" and decision/commitment means different things in the short and long term. In the short-term, it refers to "the decision that one loves a certain other", and in the long-term, it refers to "one's commitment to maintain that love."[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_theory_of_love#cite_note-Sternberg,_Robert_1997-2)
